## Biography

- Research and development expert at [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) since March 2018.

- I received my Ph.D. in software engineering from University of Oran 1 in Algeria in collaboration with University of Grenoble Alpes in France in 2017.

- I participated in numerous R&D projects with [LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/en), [Verimag](https://www-verimag.imag.fr/?lang=en) and [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes): ANR MODMED, EU BRAIN-IoT, EU CPS4EU and MODWIN.



<!---
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Verimag](https://www.verimag.fr), [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/). 

### From April 2021, I am working on :

#### [CPS4EU](https://cps4eu.eu/) 
European project which aims to deal with technical problems as well as organizational problems of CPS (Cyber Physical Systems).

### I worked on :

#### [BRAIN-IoT](https://www.brain-iot.eu/) 
European project that aims at establishing a framework and methodology that supports smart autonomous and cooperative behaviors of populations of heterogeneous IoT platforms that are also closely interacting with Cyber-Physical systems (CPS). (From April 2019 to March 2021)

#### [MODMED](http://vasco.imag.fr/MODMED/MODMEDHome.html) 
ANR project that focus on analysis of execution traces of cyber-physical systems. (From March 2018 to April 2019)

I defended my [Ph.D.](https://theses.univ-oran1.dz/document/15201707t.pdf) in computer science on 2017 at University of Oran 1 (Algeria) in collaboration with University of Grenoble Alpes (France).
